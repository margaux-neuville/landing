			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				I'm currently in my 2nd year of a Masters at the IÉSEG School of Management and would like to study in Seville for 1 year from September 2025. That's why I decided to create my website as a blog in order to share my experience with you. You will see all my journey from now until the end of my university exchange. You will follow my search for accommodation and on the spot I will give you advices on the places to discover, the restaurants to eat in or the monuments to see. So stay with me, my experience will become your experience.
